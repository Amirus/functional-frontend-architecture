Work in progress.

# Goals/ideas

* No mutations in application code.
* Testing should be easy and nothing is easier to test than pure side-effect free functions.
* State should be easily inspectable to for debugging and serialization. Also, time travel.
* Minimalism, simplicity.
* Actions should be expressed as union types.
* Time changing values and interactions with the world is introduced through FRP
